/*
Assuming that you know the popular game "Snake", you have an area of x*x,
the snake length is 1 (only the head) and is positioned in the top left corner of the area at
the beginning which means if your area is 7*7

Knowing that each time the snake eats the food his length will be 2 times longer 
(so if the length of the snake is 4, after eating it will be 8),
you have to create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns how many times
the snake needs to eat to fill the entire area.

Examples
snakefill(3) ➞ 3

snakefill(6) ➞ 5

snakefill(24) ➞ 9
